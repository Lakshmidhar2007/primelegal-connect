/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes user data privacy and enforces strict ownership for most data. Public read access is granted only to the `lawyer_profiles` collection, which contains denormalized, non-sensitive data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data. Only the authenticated user can read and write their own document.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profile information. World-readable, but only the corresponding user can create/update/delete.
 * - /chats/{chatId}/messages: Store chat messages, where chatId is a composite of the two user ids participating in the chat. Only users participating in the chat can read or write to it.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - No user listing: Listing the `/users` collection is strictly forbidden.
 * - Public lawyer profiles: The `/lawyer_profiles` collection is explicitly designed for public read access.
 * - Ownership enforced: All write operations are validated against the authenticated user's UID.
 * - Chat ownership: Chat access is granted to the participants in the chat.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `lawyer_profiles` collection contains a `userId` field that MUST match the document ID (`lawyerId`). This is enforced on create to maintain referential integrity.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Public lawyer profile information is stored in a separate `/lawyer_profiles` collection instead of being stored in the `/users/{userId}` document with a public/private flag. This ensures that we can give efficient public read access to the profile information without having to read user private data.
