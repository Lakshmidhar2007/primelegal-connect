/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-centric security model for the Prímelegal Connect application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 *  - Strict User Ownership: Users have full control over their own data (e.g., profile information).
 *  - Public Lawyer Profiles: Public profiles are readable by anyone, but only writable by the profile owner.
 *  - Shared Access for Chats: Participants of the chat have access to the chat data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 *  - /users/{userId}: Private user account data.
 *  - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Public lawyer profiles.
 *  - /chats/{chatId}: Chat messages between participants.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *  - User listing is disallowed.
 *  - Public lawyer profiles are publicly readable.
 *  - The default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - Chat documents include a `participants` array for easy access control.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - Private user data is stored in `/users/{userId}`, while public lawyer profiles are stored in `/lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}`.
