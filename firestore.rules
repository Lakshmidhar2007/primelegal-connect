/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @core-philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private user data and a public-read, owner-write model for lawyer profiles.
 * @data-structure
 *   - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data, accessible only to the user themselves.
 *   - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles, readable by anyone but writable only by the lawyer.
 * @key-security-decisions
 *   - User listing is implicitly disallowed.
 *   - Lawyer profiles are publicly readable but writable only by the profile owner.
 * @denormalization-for-authorization Lawyer profile updates are restricted by matching the authenticated user's UID to the profile ID.
 * @structural-segregation Private user data and public lawyer profiles are stored in separate collections to optimize security and read access.
