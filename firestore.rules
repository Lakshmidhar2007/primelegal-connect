/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT
 * @version Prototyping Mode - Data shape is not enforced.
 *
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user accounts and a public-read, owner-write model for lawyer profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles, readable by everyone but writable only by the profile owner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Lawyer profiles are publicly readable but only lawyers can create/modify their profiles.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId} document's ID is equivalent to the user's UID.
