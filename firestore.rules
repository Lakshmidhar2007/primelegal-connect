/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user accounts and lawyer profiles,
 * while allowing public read access to lawyer profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data. Access is restricted to the
 *   authenticated user with the matching UID.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles. These are publicly
 *   readable, but only the corresponding user can create, update, or delete their own profile.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled.
 * - Lawyer profiles are publicly readable but owner-writable.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `lawyer_profiles` documents should include the `userId` field to allow for
 *   easy owner-based security rules.
