/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a hybrid security model: strict user-ownership for private data (user accounts),
 * and public read access with owner-only writes for public lawyer profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account information. Access is restricted to the owner.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles. Publicly readable, but only the lawyer can create/update.
 * - Cases are stored as an array inside of the UserAccount document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly disallowed by the data model.
 * - Public read access to lawyer profiles allows for easy discovery.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `lawyerId` parameter in `/lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}` must match the `userId` field within the `PublicLawyerProfile` document upon creation.
