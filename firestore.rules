/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset employs a strict user-ownership model for private user data and a public-read/owner-write model for lawyer profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data. Access is restricted to the owner (the user with matching UID).
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profile data. Publicly readable, but only the owner can create/update.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Cases are modeled as a subcollection in users. This might need to be changed depending on desired features.
 * - Default security posture for ambiguous relationships is strict owner-only access.
