/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for private data,
 * allowing users to read and write their own data. Public lawyer profiles are
 * readable by anyone, but only writable by the profile owner.  Schema enforcement
 * is relaxed for rapid prototyping but authorization checks are strictly enforced.
 *
 * @data_structure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profile data.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - User listing is disabled.
 * - Public read access to /lawyer_profiles.
 * - Strict ownership checks for all write operations on private data.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 * - Lawyer profiles use the `userId` field to enforce ownership, avoiding the need for extra reads.
