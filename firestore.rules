/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT
 *
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-centric security model with public lawyer profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores private user account data, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - `/lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}`: Stores public lawyer profiles, readable by anyone, but writable only by the lawyer themselves.
 * - Cases are stored as an array within the `UserAccount` document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own user account data.
 * - Public lawyer profiles are readable by anyone.
 * - Cases are associated with user accounts and are readable/writeable only by the user who owns the account.
 * - Listing of cases is only permitted for the user who owns them.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `lawyer_profiles` collection uses the lawyer's UID as the document ID (`lawyerId`) to simplify ownership checks.
