/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for private data,
 *   while allowing public read access to lawyer profiles.
 *
 * @data_structure
 *   - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data.  Only the user can read/write.
 *   - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles. Publicly readable, but only
 *     the lawyer can create/update their profile.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 *   - Public lawyer profiles are explicitly separated from private user data.
 *   - Ambiguous cases default to owner-only access.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 *   - Lawyer profiles store the userId to allow owner-only write access.
 *
 * @structural_segregation
 *   - Private user data is stored separately from public lawyer profiles.
