/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user accounts
 * and lawyer profiles. Only authenticated users can access their own data. Public lawyer
 * profiles are readable by everyone, but only writable by the profile owner.
 *
 * @data_structure
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores private user account data.
 * - `/lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}`: Stores public lawyer profile data.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Public lawyer profiles are readable by everyone.
 * - Cases are not stored as subcollections and are instead denormalized as an array inside the user object. This approach simplifies security rules and matches the data model described.
 * - Missing chats collection is causing the reported error. Listing the contents of this collection is disallowed.
