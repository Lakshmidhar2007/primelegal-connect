/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT
 *
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user accounts and a public read, owner-write model for lawyer profiles.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data. Accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profile data. Publicly readable, writable only by the lawyer.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - Users can only access their own data under /users/{userId}.
 * - Public lawyer profiles are readable by anyone but only editable by the profile owner.
 * - Data validation is minimal in this prototyping phase, focusing on authorization and relationship integrity.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 * - Lawyer profiles use the lawyerId field to enforce ownership, avoiding the need for additional lookups.
 *
 * @structuralSegregation
 * - Private user data and public lawyer profiles are stored in separate collections to optimize read access and security.
