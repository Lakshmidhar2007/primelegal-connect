/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT.
 *
 * @corePhilosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user accounts,
 *   allowing users to manage their own data. Public lawyer profiles are readable by anyone,
 *   but only lawyers can create or modify their profiles. Cases are stored directly in the user document, only accessible by that user.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 *   /users/{userId}: Stores private user account information.
 *   /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - User listing is implicitly disallowed (no top-level collection scans allowed).
 *   - Public lawyer profiles are readable by anyone, authenticated or not.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 *   - Lawyer profiles are stored in a separate collection to allow public read access
 *     without compromising the security of user accounts.  The lawyerId is the same as the userId.
 *
 * @structuralSegregation
 *   - Public and private data are stored in separate collections (/users and /lawyer_profiles)
 *     to optimize read access and maintain security.
