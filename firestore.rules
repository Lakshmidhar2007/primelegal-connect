/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a hybrid security model. User account data is strictly
 * controlled by the owning user. Public lawyer profiles are publicly readable,
 * but only writable by the corresponding lawyer.  Case data, stored within the UserAccount document, is implicitly protected through user-level access controls.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account information.  Access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public profiles for lawyers.  Publicly readable, lawyer-owned write access.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User accounts are private and owned by the user. Listing all user accounts is disallowed.
 * - Lawyer profiles are public and designed for listing.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `PublicLawyerProfile` collection requires that the `userId` field must match the document ID (`lawyerId`) to ensure that a user can only create/modify their own profile.
