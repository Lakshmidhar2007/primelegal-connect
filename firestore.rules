/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT.
 *
 * @corePhilosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user accounts,
 *   allowing users to manage their own profiles and data. Public lawyer profiles are
 *   separated into a dedicated collection with open read access but restricted write
 *   access to the profile owner.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 *   - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data.
 *   - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profile data.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - User accounts are only accessible and modifiable by the owning user.
 *   - Public lawyer profiles are readable by anyone but writable only by the
 *     corresponding lawyer.
 *   - Listing of user accounts is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 *   - Cases are embedded inside UserAccount Documents.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 *   - The `lawyerId` in `/lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}` MUST match the `userId` in `/users/{userId}`
 *     for authorization. This prevents needing to `get()` the user document during
 *     profile updates.
