/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset employs a strict user-ownership model for private user data and a public-read, owner-write model for lawyer profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Contains private user account data. Only the user can read and write their own data.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Contains public lawyer profile data. Anyone can read, but only the lawyer can create or update their profile.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disabled to prevent unauthorized enumeration of user accounts.
 * - Public lawyer profiles are stored in a separate collection to allow public read access without compromising the privacy of user accounts.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The lawyer_profiles collection uses the lawyer's UID as the document ID (lawyerId) to easily enforce ownership.
