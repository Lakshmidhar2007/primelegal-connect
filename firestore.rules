/**
 * @fileOverview
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user accounts, allowing users to manage their profiles.
 * Public lawyer profiles are readable by all but only writable by the owning lawyer.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data, accessible only to the user.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles, readable by all, writable only by the lawyer.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User accounts are strictly private and accessible only to the authenticated user.
 * - Public lawyer profiles are publicly readable but only the owning lawyer can modify them.
 * - Data consistency is enforced between the document ID and the user ID for both user accounts and public lawyer profiles.
