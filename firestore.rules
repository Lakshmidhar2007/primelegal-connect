/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for private data,
 * with publicly readable profiles for lawyers. Data validation is relaxed to
 * allow for rapid prototyping, focusing on secure authorization.
 *
 * @data_structure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data. Only the user can read/write.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles. Publicly readable,
 *   but only the lawyer can create/update their own profile.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - User listing is generally disallowed.
 * - Public lawyer profiles are separated from private user data.
 * - Data validation is minimal in this prototyping phase.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 *   None needed. Using path-based authorization (isOwner(userId)).
 *
 * @structural_segregation
 *   Segregation of public lawyer profiles from private user data is used to
 *   allow public read access on the lawyer profiles while keeping user data private.
