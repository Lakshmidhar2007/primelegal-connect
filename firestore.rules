/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the PRIMELEGAL CONNECT application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private user data and cases,
 * while allowing public read access to lawyer profiles. Only authenticated users can access
 * their own data, and lawyer profiles are publicly accessible but only editable by the owner.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account information. Accessible only by the user.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles. Publicly readable, writable only by the lawyer.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User accounts are strictly owned by the authenticated user.
 * - Public lawyer profiles are readable by anyone but only writable by the profile owner.
 * - Listing of users is implicitly disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'userId' field is used within the lawyer_profiles collection to quickly verify ownership.
