/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the PRIMELEGAL CONNECT application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset employs a strict user-ownership model for private data and allows public read access to lawyer profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores detailed user account information. Only the user can read and write their own document.
 * - `/lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}`: Stores public lawyer profile information. Publicly readable, but only the lawyer can create or update their profile.
 * - `/chats/{chatId}/messages/{messageId}`: Stores chat messages.  Access is based on chat participants.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data under the `/users/{userId}` path.
 * - Public lawyer profiles are readable by anyone.
 * - Listing of user documents is disabled for security.
 * - Chat messages are only listable to the participants of the chat.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *   The `PublicLawyerProfile` includes a `userId` field that must match the `lawyerId` in the path, ensuring only the correct user can create/update the profile.
