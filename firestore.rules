/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for private data,
 *   while allowing public read access to lawyer profiles.
 *
 * @data_structure
 *   - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data.  Only the user can read/write.
 *   - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profile data. Publicly readable,
 *     but only the lawyer can create/update their own profile.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 *   - Lawyer profiles are publicly readable to facilitate discovery.
 *   - Default security posture is strict: any access not explicitly allowed is denied.
 *   - Cases are stored denormalized as an array in UserAccount, access control is therefore controlled by the /users/{userId} path.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 *   - Lawyer profiles contain a `userId` field, which is used to enforce ownership during create/update operations.  This avoids needing to query the `/users/{userId}` collection.
 *
 * @structural_segregation
 *   - Private user data is stored in `/users/{userId}`, while public lawyer profiles are stored in `/lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}`. This separation allows for public read access to profiles without exposing private user data.
