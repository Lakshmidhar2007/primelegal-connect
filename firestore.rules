/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user accounts and
 *  their associated data, while also allowing public read access to lawyer profiles.
 *
 * @data_structure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user account information. Only the user themselves can
 *   read and write their own document.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public-facing profiles for lawyers. This
 *   collection is publicly readable, but only the lawyer themselves can create or
 *   update their own profile.
 * - Cases are stored within the UserAccount document as an array, nested under `/users/{userId}`.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - User listing is disallowed to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
 * - Lawyer profiles are publicly readable to allow for easy discovery of lawyers.
 * - All write operations are protected by authorization checks to ensure data integrity
 *   and prevent unauthorized modifications.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 * - Lawyer profiles store the userId, avoiding the need to query the /users collection
 *   to verify ownership.
 *
 * @structural_segregation
 * - Public lawyer profiles are stored in a separate collection (`lawyer_profiles`)
 *   from private user account data (`users`) to allow for public read access without
 *   compromising user privacy.
