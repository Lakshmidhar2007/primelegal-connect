/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Prímelegal Connect.
 *
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user accounts and lawyer profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data. Only the user can read/write their own document.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profile data.  Read access is public, but write access is restricted to the profile owner.
 * - Cases are stored as an array in the user document
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User accounts are strictly private; only the owner can read or write them.
 * - Lawyer profiles are publicly readable but only writable by the profile owner.
 * - Listing of users or lawyer profiles is allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Lawyer profiles store the userId to easily verify ownership during updates.
