     * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user data, allowing only the authenticated user to read and write their own data. It also provides public read access to lawyer profiles while maintaining lawyer-only write access.
     * @dataStructure
     * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account information.
     * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profile information.
     * @keySecurityDecisions
     * - Users can only access their own data.
     * - Lawyer profiles are publicly readable.
     * - Data types and schema are not strictly enforced (prototyping mode).
     * @denormalizationForAuthorization The rules for /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId} denormalizes the userId from request.auth to the document to avoid a get() call in the rules.
     * @structuralSegregation Separate collections are used for private user data and public lawyer profiles.
