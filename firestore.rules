/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private user data and allows public read access to lawyer profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User data is stored under `/users/{userId}`, accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - Public lawyer profiles are stored under `/lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}` and are publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data.
 * - Public lawyer profiles are readable by everyone, but only writable by the profile owner.
 * - Data consistency is enforced between document IDs and the user's UID.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Lawyer profiles store the `userId` to ensure that only the correct user can modify their profile.
