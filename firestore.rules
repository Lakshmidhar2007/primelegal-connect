/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user accounts and lawyer profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores private user account data. Only the user can read/write.
 * - `/lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}`: Stores public lawyer profile data. Publicly readable, but only the lawyer can create/update.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is generally disallowed to protect privacy.
 * - Public lawyer profiles are stored in a separate collection for efficient, public read access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `lawyer_profiles` documents are named using the `userId` from the `users` collection to allow owner-only write access without additional `get()` calls.
