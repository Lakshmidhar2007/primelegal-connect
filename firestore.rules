/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user accounts and their associated cases. Public lawyer profiles are readable by anyone, but only writable by the profile owner.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user account information. Cases are denormalized inside the UserAccount document as an array.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user account data.
 * - Users can list the cases associated with their user id, which are denormalized inside the user document.
 * - Lawyer profiles are publicly readable but only writable by the profile owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `cases` are denormalized as an array in the user document.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Public lawyer profiles are stored in a separate `lawyer_profiles` collection to allow for public read access without compromising the privacy of user account data.
