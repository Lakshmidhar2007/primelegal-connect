/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for private data and allows public read access to lawyer profiles.
 *
 * @data_structure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data, accessible only to the user.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles, readable by anyone, but writable only by the lawyer themselves.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - Users can only access their own data under /users/{userId}.
 * - Public lawyer profiles are readable by everyone but only writable by the profile owner.
 * - The cases subcollection is accessible only by the owner of the user account.
