/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user accounts and allows public read access to lawyer profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data. Accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profile data. Publicly readable, writable only by the lawyer.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data under /users/{userId}.
 * - Lawyer profiles are publicly readable but only lawyers can edit their own profiles.
