/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user accounts and lawyer profiles, 
 * while allowing public read access to lawyer profiles. Cases are embedded within the user document.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data. Only the user can read/write their own document.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profile data. Publicly readable, but only the lawyer can create/update/delete their own profile.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User accounts are private; only the owning user can access them.
 * - Lawyer profiles are publicly readable to facilitate discovery.
 * - Cases are embedded within the user document, inheriting the user's ownership.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `lawyerId` in `/lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}` must match the `userId` in `/users/{userId}` to ensure ownership.
 *   This avoids the need for complex `get()` calls to verify ownership across collections.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Public lawyer profiles are stored in a separate `lawyer_profiles` collection, distinct from the private user data in `users`.
 *   This allows for efficient public listing of lawyers without exposing private user information.
