/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user accounts and lawyer profiles.
 *   Cases exist directly on the user document, implying ownership.
 *   Public lawyer profiles are readable by anyone, but only lawyers can create/update their own profiles.
 *
 * @data_structure
 *   /users/{userId} - Stores private user account information.
 *   /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId} - Stores public lawyer profiles.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 *   - Users can only access their own user data.
 *   - Public lawyer profiles are publicly readable.
 *   - Cases are owned by the user and stored directly on their UserAccount document.
 *   - Listing all users is disallowed for privacy.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 *   - Lawyer profiles use the userId as the document ID for easy ownership checks.
