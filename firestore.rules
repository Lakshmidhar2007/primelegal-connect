/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset employs a strict user-ownership model for private user data and a
 * public-read, owner-write model for lawyer profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data. Access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles.  Publicly readable, but only the lawyer can create/update/delete their profile.
 * - Cases are stored as an array inside of the UserAccount document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Public lawyer profiles under `/lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}` are publicly readable.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Cases are stored within the user document. They can only be read if the user document can be read.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - Lawyer profiles store the `userId` to easily verify ownership during updates/deletes.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - Public lawyer profiles are stored in a separate collection (`lawyer_profiles`) from private user data (`users`) to enable public read access without exposing private information.
