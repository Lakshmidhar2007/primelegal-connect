/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own data stored under their unique user ID.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own user account documents.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` is used both as the document ID and a field within the document.  This allows for direct authorization checks without additional reads.

     * @allow (update) - User with UID 'user_abc' can update their own account data.
     * @allow (delete) - User with UID 'user_abc' can delete their own account data.
     * @deny (create) - User with UID 'user_xyz' cannot create an account with ID 'user_abc'.
     * @deny (get) - User with UID 'user_xyz' cannot read account data for user 'user_abc'.
     * @deny (update) - User with UID 'user_xyz' cannot update account data for user 'user_abc'.
     * @deny (delete) - User with UID 'user_xyz' cannot delete account data for user 'user_abc'.
     * @principle Enforces document ownership for all operations.
