/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for PrímeLegal Connect
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user accounts and a public-read, owner-write model for lawyer profiles.
 * @data_structure User data is stored under `/users/{userId}`. Lawyer profiles, containing public information, are stored under `/lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}`. Cases are stored as an array directly within User documents, which is non-ideal for querying and scaling.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *  - Users can only access their own data under `/users/{userId}`.
 *  - Lawyer profiles in `/lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}` are publicly readable but only writable by the profile owner.
 *  - Listing of user documents in `/users` is disallowed.
 *  - The cases collection is not used because cases are embedded directly into the UserAccount document.
