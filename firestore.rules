/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user accounts,
 * ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own data.
 * Public lawyer profiles are readable by everyone, but writable only by the profile owner.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data.  Access is restricted to the owning user.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles. Publicly readable, owner-writable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User accounts are strictly private; listing all users is not permitted.
 * - Public lawyer profiles are separated from private user data for open access while maintaining ownership.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `lawyer_profiles` documents must have a `userId` field that matches the document ID (`lawyerId`). This is validated on create.  Updates also enforce this immutability.
