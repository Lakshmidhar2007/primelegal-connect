/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user accounts and their associated data.
 * Lawyer profiles are publicly readable but writable only by the owning lawyer.
 *
 * @data_structure
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores private user account information. Accessible only by the user themselves.
 * - `/users/{userId}/cases/{caseId}`: Stores case data associated with a user. Accessible only by the user.
 * - `/lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}`: Stores public profile information for lawyers. Publicly readable, but writable only by the lawyer.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - User listing is explicitly denied.
 * - Data validation is relaxed during this prototyping phase to allow for rapid schema iteration.
 * - Read-only collections are permitted for explicitly public data.
 * - All write operations are strictly controlled based on user identity.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 * - The `lawyer_profiles` collection includes the `userId` to enable simple ownership checks.
 *
 * @structural_segregation
 * - Private user data is stored under `/users/{userId}`, while public lawyer profiles are stored in `/lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}`.
