/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT
 * @version Prototyping Mode - Data shape is not enforced; authorization is strict.
 *
 * @Core Philosophy:
 *  This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private user data and
 *  allows public read access to lawyer profiles. Write access is restricted to
 *  authenticated users, with ownership checks based on the `request.auth.uid`.
 *
 * @Data Structure:
 *  - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account information.
 *  - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles.
 *
 * @Key Security Decisions:
 *  - Users can only read and write their own user documents.
 *  - Public lawyer profiles are readable by everyone but writable only by the
 *    profile owner.
 *  - Data validation is minimized for prototyping but includes essential checks
 *    for authorization and relational integrity.
 *
 * @Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `lawyer_profiles` document `lawyerId` is required to match the authenticated
 *    user's UID to simplify owner validation.
