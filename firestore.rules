/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the PRIMELEGAL CONNECT application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user accounts and their associated cases.
 * Public lawyer profiles are readable by anyone, but only lawyers can manage their own profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data. Accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles. Publicly readable, writeable only by the owning lawyer.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data.
 * - Public lawyer profiles allow public read access, with ownership enforced for writes.
 * - Listing of all users is disallowed for privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `lawyerId` in `lawyer_profiles` must match the `userId` of the corresponding user for authorization.
