/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user accounts and lawyer profiles.
 * Users can only read and write their own data, while public lawyer profiles are readable by everyone.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data. Only the user can read/write.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles. Readable by all, writable only by the lawyer.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users cannot list all user accounts.
 * - Public lawyer profiles are readable by anyone, even unauthenticated users.
 * - Data validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping, focusing on authorization.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The lawyer_profiles documents contain the userId, so there is no need to query the users collection.
