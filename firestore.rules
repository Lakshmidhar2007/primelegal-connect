/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user accounts and public read access for lawyer profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles, publicly readable but writable only by the lawyer.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own user account data.
 * - Lawyer profiles are publicly readable.
 * - Only the lawyer can create/update their profile.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId} document ID is equal to the corresponding users/{userId} document.
