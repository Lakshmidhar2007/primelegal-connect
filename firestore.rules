/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the PRIMELEGAL CONNECT application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user accounts and lawyer profiles.
 * Users can only read and write their own data. Public lawyer profiles are readable by anyone,
 * but only writable by the profile owner.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profile data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User accounts are strictly private and only accessible to the owning user.
 * - Public lawyer profiles are publicly readable, but only writable by the owning lawyer.
 * - Listing of user accounts is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The `lawyer_profiles` collection enforces that `userId` must match the `lawyerId` to maintain
 *    referential integrity and avoid potentially costly `get()` calls.
