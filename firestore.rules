/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user accounts and lawyer profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data. Only the authenticated user can read and write their own data.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profile data. Anyone can read these profiles, but only the lawyer can create or modify their own profile.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data under the /users/{userId} path.
 * - Lawyer profiles are publicly readable but only writable by the profile owner.
 * - The `cases` array stored inside `UserAccount` should not be accessed directly. Listing all `cases` at the top level is denied.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `lawyer_profiles` collection uses the `userId` field to ensure that only the authenticated user matching the `lawyerId` path can modify their own profile.
