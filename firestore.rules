/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user accounts and lawyer profiles.
 * Users can only read and write their own data. Public lawyer profiles are readable by everyone,
 * but only writable by the owning lawyer.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores private user account data, accessible only by the user.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles, publicly readable but only writable by the lawyer.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User accounts are strictly private, accessible only to the authenticated user.
 * - Public lawyer profiles are publicly readable, enabling a directory of lawyers.
 * - Write access to lawyer profiles is restricted to the profile owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The lawyer_profiles collection requires that the lawyerId matches the user's UID for write operations.

     * @principle Enforces document ownership for all operations on user accounts.
