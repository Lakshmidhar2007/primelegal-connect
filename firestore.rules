/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for PRIMELEGAL CONNECT application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a hybrid security model: strict user-ownership for private data
 * (e.g., user accounts) and public read access with owner-only writes for public lawyer profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}:  Stores private user account information. Only the user can read/write their own document.
 * - /lawyer_profiles/{lawyerId}: Stores public lawyer profiles.  Publicly readable, but only the lawyer can create/update/delete their own profile.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User accounts are strictly private; no listing is allowed.
 * - Public lawyer profiles are publicly readable to allow for discovery.  Writes are restricted to the profile owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Lawyer profiles denormalize the userId to enable `isOwner()` checks.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Public lawyer profiles are stored in a separate, top-level collection to enable public read access without compromising user account privacy.
